# Basic Computational Linear Algebra

In the world of data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing, linear algebra serves as a fundamental pillar. This README provides an introduction to some essential concepts in computational linear algebra, focusing on matrix-vector multiplication, outer products, computing the rank, and matrix inversion with rank 1.

## Matrix-Vector Multiplication

Matrix-vector multiplication is a fundamental operation where a matrix is multiplied by a vector to produce a new vector. From a computational perspective, this involves iterating through rows of the matrix and performing dot products with the vector elements.

## Outer Products

An outer product is a way to combine two vectors to create a matrix. It results in a matrix where each element is the product of the corresponding elements of the input vectors. Outer products find applications in various fields, including image processing and statistics.

## Computing the Rank

The rank of a matrix is a measure of its linear independence and is crucial in determining the dimension of the column space. Computationally, it involves performing operations like row reductions to bring the matrix to its row-echelon form, counting the number of non-zero rows.

## Inversion of Matrix with Rank 1

Matrix inversion is a powerful operation, but not all matrices are invertible. When a matrix has rank 1, its inversion can be simplified. Computationally, you can use techniques like the Sherman-Morrison formula, which provides a way to invert a rank-1 modified matrix based on the inverse of the original matrix.

## Conclusion

Understanding basic computational linear algebra concepts is essential for tackling a wide range of numerical challenges. These concepts form the building blocks for more advanced techniques in machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing.
