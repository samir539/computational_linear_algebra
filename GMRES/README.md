# GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual) Algorithm

GMRES is a popular iterative method used to solve large, sparse systems of linear equations. This README provides insights into the key components of the GMRES algorithm, including Arnoldi iterations, Krylov subspace methods, and the GMRES algorithm itself.

## Arnoldi Iterations

Arnoldi iterations are at the heart of GMRES. They generate a sequence of orthogonal vectors that span a Krylov subspace, which is a finite-dimensional subspace built using matrix-vector multiplications and vector orthogonalization. The Arnoldi process constructs the basis of the Krylov subspace, enabling us to iteratively refine the solution in GMRES.

## Krylov Subspace Methods

Krylov subspace methods are iterative techniques designed to solve large linear systems by focusing on a subspace built from the repeated application of the matrix to a starting vector. The Arnoldi process plays a significant role in constructing this subspace. Krylov subspace methods offer a powerful way to handle systems with sparse matrices, avoiding the need for direct matrix factorizations.

## GMRES Algorithm

The GMRES algorithm utilizes the Krylov subspace constructed through Arnoldi iterations to find an approximate solution to a given linear system. GMRES minimizes the residual of the system over the Krylov subspace, making it particularly suitable for solving systems with irregular or ill-conditioned matrices.

The key strength of GMRES lies in its ability to handle nonsymmetric, sparse, and large matrices. It converges towards the solution by iteratively refining the approximation and is renowned for its flexibility and robustness.

## Conclusion

GMRES, armed with Arnoldi iterations and Krylov subspace methods, offers a powerful approach to tackling linear systems arising in various scientific, engineering, and computational domains. Its versatility, ability to handle complex matrices, and iterative nature make it an essential tool in the toolbox of numerical linear algebra practitioners.
