# LUP (LU with Partial Pivoting) Factorization

LUP factorization is a powerful technique in numerical linear algebra that decomposes a matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix, an upper triangular matrix, and a permutation matrix. This README provides insights into the key aspects of LUP factorization, including in-place LUP factorization, solving lower and upper triangular systems, solving Ax=b systems using LUP, and finding the determinant of a matrix using LUP.

## In-Place LUP Factorization

LUP factorization improves upon LU decomposition by incorporating partial pivoting, which enhances numerical stability. In-place LUP factorization optimizes memory usage by storing the L, U, and P factors within the original matrix. This approach offers both memory efficiency and numerical robustness.

## Solving Lower and Upper Triangular Systems

LUP factorization simplifies solving linear systems. Given A = LUP, solving Ax = b involves solving three consecutive systems: Ly = Pb (solved for y using forward substitution), Uz = y (solved for z using backward substitution), and Px = z (solved for x using forward substitution). These triangular systems are easier to solve than the original system Ax = b, making LUP factorization a valuable tool for solving linear systems.

## Solving Ax=b Systems Using LUP

LUP factorization also allows for efficient solution of linear systems of the form Ax = b. By utilizing the L and U factors computed during the factorization, the system can be solved through the forward-backward substitution process, yielding accurate and reliable results.

## Finding the Determinant of a Matrix Using LUP

The determinant of a matrix can be efficiently computed using LUP factorization. By evaluating the product of the diagonal elements of the U factor and incorporating the parity of the permutation matrix P, the determinant can be obtained without the need for costly operations like expansion by minors.

## Conclusion

LUP factorization, incorporating partial pivoting, is a versatile and robust tool in numerical linear algebra. Its ability to decompose a matrix into lower and upper triangular factors, along with permutation, enhances the accuracy and efficiency of solving linear systems, computing determinants, and performing various matrix operations.
