# Householder Transformations

Householder transformations are a crucial tool in numerical linear algebra, offering elegant methods for various operations involving matrices and vectors. This README provides insights into different applications of Householder transformations, including Householder reflections, solving upper triangular systems with forward substitution, using Householder to solve Ax=b type problems, finding QR factorizations, and solving least squares problems.

## Householder Reflections

Householder reflections are orthogonal transformations used to zero out specific entries in a vector. By choosing a Householder vector that targets a particular column, we can eliminate all elements below a certain position, creating an upper triangular structure. These reflections are pivotal for various factorization and solving techniques.

## Solving Upper Triangular Systems with Forward Substitution

When dealing with upper triangular systems of equations, forward substitution offers a way to solve for the unknowns in a systematic manner. Householder reflections aid in transforming a matrix into an upper triangular form, simplifying the process of solving equations by back-substituting values.

## Using Householder to Solve Ax=b Type Problems

Householder transformations extend their utility to solving linear systems of equations, where Ax = b. Utilizing Householder reflections, we can transform matrix A into a triangular form and then solve the system efficiently using back-substitution, revealing the solutions for vector x.

## Finding QR Factorizations with Householder

Householder transformations play a pivotal role in computing QR factorizations of matrices. QR factorization decomposes a matrix into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R. Householder reflections serve as the tool to iteratively zero out subdiagonal entries of matrix A, ultimately leading to the QR decomposition.

## Householder for Least Squares Problems

In the realm of least squares problems, Householder transformations offer a robust technique. By performing QR factorization using Householder reflections, we can efficiently solve overdetermined systems and minimize the residual error, providing a least squares solution.

In conclusion, Householder transformations stand as a versatile and powerful tool in the arsenal of numerical linear algebra. They facilitate a wide range of operations, from creating structured matrices to solving systems of equations and factorizations.
